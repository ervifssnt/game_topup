\## Post-Deployment Security Improvements (October 2025)



\### 3. Password Reset System Overhaul

\*\*Date:\*\* October 23, 2025
\*\*Severity:\*\* Medium (Configuration/Design Issue)
\*\*Status:\*\* FIXED



\*\*Issue:\*\*
Application had dual password reset systems causing confusion and maintenance overhead:
\- Admin-approved system requiring manual intervention
\- Standard Laravel token-based system (partially implemented)
\- Both systems coexisting, creating security and UX concerns



\*\*Description:\*\*
The original implementation required users to submit password reset requests that would be manually reviewed and approved by administrators. This approach:
\- Created unnecessary bottlenecks for users
\- Increased admin workload
\- Deviated from industry-standard self-service password reset flows
\- Maintained `password\_reset\_requests` table for admin-approved flow



\*\*Resolution:\*\*
Completely removed admin-approved system and fully implemented standard Laravel token-based password reset:

\- \*\*Removed Components:\*\*
  \- `password\_reset\_requests` table (dropped via migration)
  \- `PasswordResetRequest.php` model
  \- Admin approval routes and views
  \- Manual password reset workflow

\- \*\*Implemented Features:\*\*
  \- Self-service token-based reset with 60-minute expiration
  \- Uses standard Laravel `password\_reset\_tokens` table
  \- Secure token generation and validation
  \- Generic responses preventing user enumeration
  \- Email notifications (currently logged, ready for SMTP)

\- \*\*Added Monitoring:\*\*
  \- New "Password Reset Activity" admin page (`/admin/password-reset-activity`)
  \- Comprehensive audit logging of all reset events
  \- Tracks IPs, user agents, timestamps, and status
  \- Color-coded badges for event types (initiated, completed, failed)



\*\*Testing:\*\*
Comprehensive testing performed across 6 scenarios:
1\. ✓ Successful password reset flow
2\. ✓ Invalid/expired token handling
3\. ✓ Non-existent email handling
4\. ✓ Password validation enforcement
5\. ✓ Audit log creation
6\. ✓ Admin monitoring functionality

See `TESTING\_SUMMARY.md` for detailed test results.



\*\*Benefits:\*\*
\- ✅ Improved user experience (instant self-service reset)
\- ✅ Reduced admin workload (no manual intervention required)
\- ✅ Industry-standard security practices
\- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
\- ✅ Better security through automated token expiration
\- ✅ Maintains user enumeration protection



\*\*Technical Changes:\*\*
```
Files Modified:
\- routes/web.php (updated reset routes)
\- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminController.php (added passwordResetActivity())
\- resources/views/admin/password-reset-activity.blade.php (new view)

Files Removed:
\- app/Models/PasswordResetRequest.php
\- resources/views/admin/password-reset-requests/ (3 view files)

Migrations:
\- 2025\_10\_23\_155526\_drop\_password\_reset\_requests\_table.php
```



---



\### 4. Registration Email Requirement

\*\*Date:\*\* October 23, 2025
\*\*Severity:\*\* Medium
\*\*Status:\*\* FIXED



\*\*Issue:\*\*
User registration allowed accounts without email addresses, breaking password reset functionality.



\*\*Resolution:\*\*
\- Made email field required in registration validation
\- Updated `StoreUserRequest.php` validation rules
\- Password reset now guaranteed to have valid email



---



\### 5. Type Safety - InputSanitizer Fix

\*\*Date:\*\* October 23, 2025
\*\*Severity:\*\* Low
\*\*Status:\*\* FIXED



\*\*Issue:\*\*
`InputSanitizer::sanitizeString()` could return `null`, causing type mismatches.



\*\*Resolution:\*\*
\- Updated return type to ensure non-null strings
\- Added fallback to empty string for null inputs
\- Improved type safety across validation layer



---
